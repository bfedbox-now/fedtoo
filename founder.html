      <h1>About the Founder</h1>

      <p>
        Dr. Beata Agnieszka Tornado Czupak was born in Poland — a country she felt was never truly her home. At just five years old, she knew her heart belonged to the United States of America, and her journey to come home as a contributing, valuable individual began. At eighteen, that dream became reality. To assimilate, she adopted the name Heather Dye and set out to embody the ideals of her homeland through hard work, dedication, service, and excellence.
      </p>

      <p>
        She worked nights and took one class a semester to earn her education—step by step, driven by determination and faith in the uniquely American opportunity to realize one’s fullest potential. Her life changed when Arizona State University hired her as an undergraduate researcher. From that moment on, it was the American people who invested in her mind. That gift instilled in her a profound sense of gratitude and duty—to give back to our nation that had given her everything.
      </p>

      <p>
        Dr. Czupak is a proud American by choice and an engineer by calling. A naturalized citizen with an unshakable belief in the promise of fairness and opportunity, she joined the federal government workforce to serve the American people through science, integrity, and public service. Her journey reflects the best of what this nation stands for—dedication, excellence, and the courage to speak truth in the pursuit of safety and accountability. Guided by faith in the ideals that made our country strong, she worked to protect communities and to repay her debt of gratitude for the gift of free education—by applying her skills and talents in service to the American people by working for USA federal government as an engineer and a technical expert.
      </p>

      <p>
      Though competent and initially regarded as performing well, Dr. Czupak came to experience discrimination as a foreign-born woman (also experienced by other women) and observed other improprieties that conflicted with her sense of duty.  Believing that integrity requires action, she raised her concerns through multiple official channels, including the Equal Employment Opportunity system, administrative grievances, internal audit, and the Office of Inspector General.  She also reached out to members of Congress, requesting a formal hearing to ensure accountability, adherence to law and regulation, responsible use of public funds, and to advance constructive reform (the outreach is on-going).  Rather than the issues she reported being corrected, she instead faced severe retaliation and ultimately was terminated in 2025.  The justification offered — she was disrespectful for internally disclosing issues requesting intervention and lack of collboration with others — does not withstand review of records illustrating continued efforts to collaborate with others and share knowledge.  As happens all too often in government service, speaking out did not fix the problems; it silenced the one who tried, by elimination.
      </p>

      <p>
      The very institution she had served turned against both her and the values it was meant to uphold. The experience was profoundly traumatic — a crisis not only of work but of identity. In reclaiming her birth name, Beata, she reclaimed her voice and her purpose. It was an act of self-preservation and a declaration that integrity and truth remain the highest forms of patriotism.
      </p>

      <p>
        Her story is one of renewal and conviction. It stands as a reminder that America’s strength lies in its citizens — those who believe deeply in the enduring promise of liberty, justice, and service to others.
