      <h1>Federal Government Integrity Platform</h1>
      <p>
      Site Under Construction — Join the List (Anonymously)
      </p>
      <p>
      This platform is being developed by and for current and former federal employees committed to integrity in public service.  If you have witnessed or experienced violations of laws, rules, or regulations, or official policies; gross mismanagement; gross waste of funds; abuse of authority; discrimination; retaliation; or any substantial and specific danger to public health or safety — you are not alone. <br><br>
      
      The Federal Government Integrity Platform exists to connect and support those who believe that integrity is not optional — that our structure, our system itself, is sacred, designed by founders who understood human nature and the risks it brings to any government.  They built a framework of laws, checks, and accountability to guard against those risks — a system meant to serve, not rule; to correct itself, not conceal its flaws. <br><br>
      
      That system is not negotiable.<br><br>
      
      The American people deserve a government that honors that design, upholds its own laws and rules, and fulfills its responsibilities to its citizens through competence, transparency, and respect.
      

      </p>
      <p>
      For your safety, we recommend creating a separate email account and using an alias when signing up. Your identity remains confidential; your information will never be shared; even better if we do not have your information, there is nothing to turn over under subpeona. Your truth and experience matter — together they strengthen this community.

      </p>
      <p>
      This is a nonpartisan, professional, and respectful space. Federal employees serve all Americans, not political parties. Hate speech, political commentary, or posts from individuals who are not current or former U.S. federal employees will be removed. This platform is dedicated solely to fact-based reporting, education, and constructive reform within federal service.
      </p>
      <h1>Our Creed</h1>
      <p>
      America’s strength depends on the competence, courage, integrity, civility, and conscience of those who serve her.  Every system tends toward disorder unless it is actively maintained. Our federal institutions are no exception. When the structures built by law, regulation, policy, and procedure are treated as suggestions instead of obligations — when rules become “yellow lights” instead of red lines — the foundation of public trust begins to erode.  The structure itself is sacred: an architecture of accountability that transforms power into service and authority into duty. It is the covenant between those who govern and those who are governed — a daily act of respect for the law, for order, and for the American people who rely on its protection.
      </p>
      <p><strong>
          To neglect that structure is to weaken the Republic.
      </strong></p>
      <p><strong>
      To defend it is to honor the promise of the United States itself.
      </strong></p>
      
      <h1>Our Mission</h1>
      <p>
      We stand to restore adherence to law, governing procedure, competence, efficiency, civility, and integrity to public service. Truth and courage are the foundation of national strength. Every act of silence in the face of wrongdoing weakens our country; every act of honesty strengthens it.  This platform exists to support integrity, protect truth-tellers, and connect those who refuse to look away. It provides educational resources, secure communication tools, and the collective power to identify and correct systemic failures within our government.
      </p>
      <p>
      We are building a secure, independent network where current and former federal employees can:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Learn how to document and report violations of law, ethics, or procedure safely and responsibly</li>
        <li>Access official manuals and procedures for HR, EEO, IG, OSC, grievances, and MSPB processes</li>
        <li>Follow clear, step-by-step guides for navigating EEO, IG, OSC, grievance and MSPB actions</li>
        <li>Obtain a clear, evidence-based overview of the internal tactics and response patterns used by Agencies to isolate, discredit, erase contributions, and pressure employees to quit their jobs, who report misconduct through EEO, IG, or OSC channels (compiled from Whistleblower of the Week podcast with Jane Turner).</li>
        <li>Connect with attorneys, journalists, and reform advocates committed to accountability</li>
        <li>Combine verified data to reveal systemic patterns of misconduct and deliver supported by evidence truth to oversight bodies and Congress</li>
        <li>Pursue collective constructive improvements, reforms, or class-based actions when justice and transparency require it</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
      This is more than a website.  It is a living system of accountability, built by public servants, to strengthen the structures that already safeguard our Nation. When we work together and uphold the rules, procedures, and principles already in place, the system works as intended. Take action now!  Our collective integrity is the foundation of a government that truly serves the American People.
      </p>
      
      
      
      <h1>Meetups: Stand Together</h1>
      
      <p>
      We are organizing local Integrity Meetups across the United States — gatherings of current and former federal employees who believe in honesty, accountability, and service above politics. <br><br>
      
      Meetups are not protests — they are conversations. <br><br>
      
      We meet in libraries, coffee shops, and public spaces to exchange knowledge, share experiences, and build trust.  These small, respectful circles create the foundation for reform and community.
      </p>
      
      <h1>How to Join or Host Meetup</h1>
      
      <ul>
        <li> Create an alias name and a separate email for privacy. </li>
        <li>       Email beata@fed-box.org with your city and state, and note whether you’d like to attend or host a meetup. </li>
        <li>       You’ll be connected with others nearby who share your values of competence, courage, and integrity. </li>
      
      </ul>
          
          
        <p> Meetups are open to U.S. citizens residing in the United States who are current or former federal employees.<br><br>

      Together we can transform frustration into reform, isolation into action, and silence into strength.
