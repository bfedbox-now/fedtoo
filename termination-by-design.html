      <h1>Termination by Design: A Modern Don Quixote in Federal Service</h1>
      <p class="meta">
        Dr. Beata Agnieszka Tornado Czupak · January 3, 2026
      </p>

      <p>
        So, the federal government fired you—and you’re still wondering why you received such a special treatment.
      </p>

      <p>
       Let me guess. Something small happened. You raised your hand and said, “Excuse me—little help here, please.” 
        To your surprise, no help came. So, you documented it in an email, as any rational professional would.  
        That’s when the environment shifted.  Work became harder. Deadlines that were once flexible became impossible. 
        Expectations changed without notice or explanation. Every action you took was scrutinized. Work that met requirements 
        before was suddenly deemed unacceptable and rejected over formatting, phrasing, or process, never substance.
      </p>

     <p>
       Employees who experience this pattern may encounter a troubling statistic: a disproportionate number of federal employees 
       who file EEO complaints eventually leave their agencies, frequently through termination. The possibility that this outcome 
       could occur to you appears implausible—until it does.
